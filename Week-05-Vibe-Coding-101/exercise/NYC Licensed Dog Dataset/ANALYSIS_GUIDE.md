# NYC Licensed Dog Data Analysis Guide

This guide explains how to use the data analysis tools created for the NYC Licensed Dog Dataset.

## 📊 Analysis Tools Created

### 1. Data Analysis Script (`data_analysis.py`)

A comprehensive Python script that generates all the visualizations and analysis charts based on the PRD requirements.

**Features:**

- ✅ Most common dog names analysis
- ✅ Oldest/youngest dog identification
- ✅ Breed distribution analysis
- ✅ Geographic (zip code) analysis
- ✅ License expiry analysis
- ✅ License issuance pattern analysis
- ✅ Overview dashboard with key metrics

### 2. Interactive Dashboard (`dashboard.py`)

A Streamlit web application providing an interactive interface for exploring the data.

**Features:**

- 🎛️ Interactive filtering (breed, zip code, gender, age)
- 📈 Real-time chart updates based on filters
- 🔍 Search functionality
- 📥 Data export capabilities
- 📱 Responsive design

## 🚀 How to Run the Analysis

### Option 1: Generate Static Charts and Analysis

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Download sample data (if not already done)
python download_data.py --sample 1000 --output sample_data.csv

# Run comprehensive analysis
python data_analysis.py
```

This will generate interactive charts in your browser and print detailed analysis results to the console.

### Option 2: Run Interactive Dashboard

```bash
# Install dependencies (if not already done)
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Make sure you have sample_data.csv in the directory
# Run the interactive dashboard
streamlit run dashboard.py
```

This will open a web browser with the interactive dashboard at `http://localhost:8501`

### Charts Generated:

1. **Overview Dashboard** - Key metrics and summary statistics
2. **Dog Names Analysis** - Top names, name length distribution, trends
3. **Demographics Analysis** - Age distribution, oldest/youngest dogs
4. **Breed Analysis** - Most/least common breeds, distribution charts
5. **Geographic Analysis** - Zip code distribution and density
6. **License Expiry Analysis** - Expiring licenses and timeline
7. **Temporal Patterns** - Monthly, yearly, and weekday licensing patterns

## 🎯 PRD Requirements Fulfilled

All 6 analytical questions from the Product Requirements Document have been addressed:

1. ✅ **"What kind of dogs' names are the most common?"** - Comprehensive name analysis with top names, trends, and categorization
2. ✅ **"What is the oldest dog? What is the youngest dog?"** - Identified with detailed information cards
3. ✅ **"Which kind of dog breeds are the most/least common?"** - Top and bottom breed analysis with visualizations
4. ✅ **"Which zipcode has the most/least number of dogs?"** - Geographic analysis with zip code rankings
5. ✅ **"Which dog license is gonna be expired in next month?"** - License expiry analysis with alerts and tables
6. ✅ **"Explain dog license issued patterns?"** - Temporal analysis with monthly, yearly, and daily patterns

## 🔧 Customization Options

### For Larger Datasets:

- Use `download_data.py` to get more data: `python download_data.py --limit 50000 --output large_dataset.csv`
- Update the file path in both scripts to use your larger dataset

### For Different Time Periods:

- Use date filters: `python download_data.py --start-date 2020-01-01 --end-date 2023-12-31 --output recent_data.csv`

### For Specific Areas:

- Filter by zip codes: `python download_data.py --zipcodes 10001,10002,10003 --output manhattan_dogs.csv`
